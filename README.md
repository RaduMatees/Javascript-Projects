JavaScript Projects
===

---

  The main idea was becoming comfortable with Vanilla JavaScript and working
with the DOM without a library. The project covers a large area of
JavaScript's fundamentals, from working with common web interfaces (clicking
and dragging around), to working with API's, HTML5 Canvas, local storage,
speech synthesis, videos and webcam, and also helped me solidify my
functional programming knowledge.
